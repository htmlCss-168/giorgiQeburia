    <p class="info">The work was commissioned by Napoleon orally in September 1804, and Jaques-Louis started work on it on 21 December 1805 in the former chapel of the College of Cluny, near the Sorbonne, which served as a workshop. Assisted by his student Georges Rouget, he put the finishing touches in January 1808. From 7 February to 22 March 1808, the work was exhibited at the Salon annual painting display in 1808, and it was presented to the Salon decennial prize competition in 1810. The painting remained the property of David until 1819, when it was transferred to the Royal Museums, where it was stored in the reserves until 1837. Then, it was installed in the Chamber Sacre of the museum of the historical Palace of Versailles on the orders of King Louis-Philippe. In 1889, the painting was transferred to the Louvre from Versailles.</p>

<p class="info">The Raft of the Medusa (French: Le Radeau de la Méduse [lə ʁado d(ə) la medyz])  originally titled Scène de Naufrage (Shipwreck Scene) - is an oil painting of 1818-19 by the French Romantic painter and lithographer Théodore Géricault (1791-1824). Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491 by 716 cm (16 ft 1 in by 23 ft 6 in), it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate Méduse, which ran aground off the coast of today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism (the custom of the sea). The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.</p>

    <p class="info">The Great Sphinx of Tanis is a granite sculpture of a sphinx, whose date may be as early as the 26th century BC. It was discovered in the ruins of the Temple of Amun-Ra in Tanis, Egypt's capital during the 21st Dynasty and the 23rd Dynasty. It was created much earlier, but when exactly remains debated with hypotheses of the 4th Dynasty or the 12th Dynasty. All that is left of its original inscription are the parts alluding to pharaohs Amenemhat II (12th Dynasty), Merneptah (19th Dynasty) and Shoshenq I (22nd Dynasty). The Louvre acquired it in 1826 as part of the second Egyptian collection of Henry Salt, whose purchase was led on behalf of the French state by Jean-François Champollion. Initially plans were made to place it outdoors, at the center of the Cour Carrée, but they were not implemented. Instead, the sphinx was exhibited in the museum's courtyard, since then known as the cour du Sphinx, from 1828 until 1848, when it was relocated to the galerie Henri IV, still now the main monumental sculpture room of the museum's Egyptian Department. In the mid-1930s, the Sphinx was transferred to its present location in the crypt created by Louvre architect Albert Ferran to connect the two halves of the southern wing of the Cour Carrée.</p>

        <p class="info">The Venus de Milo (/də 'mailoʊ, də 'mi:loʊ/ də MY-loh, də MEE-loh; Ancient Greek: Ἀφροδίτη τῆς Μήλου, romanized: Aphrodítē tēs Mḗlou) is an ancient Greek sculpture that was created during the Hellenistic period, sometime between 150 and 125 BC.[1] It is one of the most famous works of ancient Greek sculpture, having been prominently displayed at the Louvre Museum since shortly after the statue was rediscovered on the island of Milos, Greece, in 1820. The Venus de Milo is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, whose Roman counterpart was Venus. The sculpture is sometimes called the Aphrodite de Milos, due to the imprecision of naming the Greek sculpture after a Roman deity (Venus).[2] Some scholars theorize that the statue actually represents the sea-goddess Amphitrite, who was venerated on the island in which the statue was found.[3] The work was originally attributed to the 4th century BC Athenian sculptor Praxiteles, but, based upon an inscription on its plinth, it is now widely agreed that the statue was created later, and instead is the work of Alexandros of Antioch.[4] Made of Parian marble, the statue is larger than life size, standing 204 cm (6 ft 8 in) high.[5] The statue is missing both arms, with part of one arm, as well as the original plinth, being lost after the statue's rediscovery.</p>

    <p class="info">The Winged Victory of Samothrace, or the Nike of Samothrace, is a votive monument originally found on the island of Samothrace, north of the Aegean Sea. It is a masterpiece of Greek sculpture from the Hellenistic era, dating from the beginning of the 2nd century BC. It is composed of a statue representing the goddess Niké (Victory), whose head and arms are missing, and its base in the shape of a ship's bow. The total height of the monument is 5.57 meters including the socle; the statue alone measures 2.75 meters. The sculpture is one of a small number of major Hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than Roman copies. Winged Victory has been exhibited at the Louvre Museum in Paris, at the top of the main staircase, since 1884. Greece is seeking the return of the sculpture.

    <p class="info">Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss (Italian: Amore e Psiche [a'mo:re e 'psi:ke]; French: Psyché ranimée par le baiser de l'Amour; Russian: Амур и Психея, romanized: Amúr i Psikhéja) is a sculpture by Italian artist Antonio Canova first commissioned in 1787 by Colonel John Campbell.[1] It is regarded as a masterpiece of Neoclassical sculpture, but shows the mythological lovers at a moment of great emotion, characteristic of the emerging movement of Romanticism. It represents the god Cupid in the height of love and tenderness, immediately after awakening the lifeless Psyche with a kiss. The story of Cupid and Psyche is taken from Lucius Apuleius' Latin novel The Golden Ass, and was popular in art. Joachim Murat acquired the first or prime version (pictured) in 1800. After his death the statue entered the Louvre Museum in Paris, France in 1824; Prince Yusupov, a Russian nobleman acquired the 2nd version of the piece from Canova in Rome in 1796, and it later entered the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. A full-scale model for the 2nd version is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

    <p class="info">The painting was the third commissioned by Isabella d'Este for her studiolo, after the two canvasses by Andrea Mantegna, the Parnassus and the Triumph of the Virtues. The paintings of the Coronation of Isabella d'Este and Reign of Comus would be completed by Lorenzo Costa. The subject was suggested by Isabella's court poet, Paride da Ceresara, documented by the correspondence between Isabella and Perugino, who was then active in Florence. The notary contract included all the details about the literary theme, as well as a drawing which the work had to be based on. For example, when Perugino painted a naked Venus, instead than dressed, the marchesa protested vigorously. In 1505, when the painting was delivered, the marchesa was not entirely satisfied. She declared that she preferred it would have been painted in oil, instead of the tempera used under her directives in order to follow Mantegna's style. Perugino, who probably was not at ease with the small format of the work, received 100 ducats for the work. After the extinction of the Gonzaga dynasty, the painting was gifted by Charles I of Nevers to cardinal Richelieu, and was thus moved to Paris. Later it was acquired by the state and was added to the collection of the Louvre.
