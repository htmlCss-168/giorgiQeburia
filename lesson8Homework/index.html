        <p>The 1969 model year restyle "added more heft to the body" with body length extended by 3.8 inches (97 mm) (the wheelbase remaining at 108 inches), width increased by almost half an inch, and the Mustang's "weight went up markedly too." 1969 was the first model to use quad headlamps placed both inside and outside the grille opening. The corralled grille pony was replaced with the pony and tribars logo, set off-center to the driver's side. The car was longer than previous models and sported convex rather than concave side panels. The fastback body version was named SportsRoof in Ford's literature.The 1969 model year saw the introduction of the Mach 1, with a variety of powerplants options and many new styling and performance features. Distinctive reflective striping was placed along the body sides, with a pop-open gas cap, dual exhausts, matte-black hood with simulated air scoop and NASCAR-style cable and pin tiedowns. It used steel wheels with white lettered Goodyear Polyglas tires. A functional "shaker" hood scoop - which visibly vibrated by being attached directly to the air cleaner through a hole in the hood - was available, as were tail-mounted wing and chin spoilers and rear window louvered blackout shade. The Mach 1 featured a deluxe interior with simulated wood trim, high-backed seats, extra sound deadening, remote sports mirrors, and other features. The Mach 1 proved popular with buyers as 72,458 cars were sold through 1969.</p>

            <p>The Legendary 1969 Dodge Charger RT is on top of everyone's list of best Classic American Muscle Cars. The Charger has stood the test of time. I'm sure we can agree that when you see one driving down the road, it still inspires many emotions. No matter, if you are a Mopar fan or not. The Charger is also one of the most recognized classic muscle cars ever. Due to, the General Lee a bright orange 69 Charger in the 80's TV show The Dukes of Hazzard. The Charger is a midsize rear-wheel drive 2 Door Hardtop build on the Chrysler B platform. The RT models hit the Showrooms in 1968. But, for most 1969 was the golden year for the Chargers. Do to the introduction of the slippery Charger 500, and the legendary Charger Daytona. The Chargers dominating the street, the strip, and NASCAR that year.R/T is the performance designation used on Dodge automobiles. The R/T models are equipped with more powerful engines, upgraded suspensions, performance tires and better brakes. The R/T cars also came with sportier trim, special paint schemes and racing stripes. In 1969 the Charger RTs came standard with Mopar's very powerful 440 Magnum engine, with the NASCAR inspired 426 Hemi as an option. Regrettably, only 432 Hemi Chargers were manufactured, making them very desirable.</p>
